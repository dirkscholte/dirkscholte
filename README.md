I am a PhD candidate in Extragalactic Astrophysics at UCL. I am studying the ways in which galxy evolution is influenced by environmental factors using the SDSS and DESI surveys ðŸ”­. 

I am deriving gas mass estimates from spectroscopy and dark matter halo masses using weak lensing. I develop photoionization models and use machine learning.
