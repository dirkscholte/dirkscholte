### Hi there 👋

**dirkscholte/dirkscholte** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am a PhD Researcher in Extragalactic Astrophysics at University College London. I study galaxy evolution using some of the largest optical spectroscopic surveys. I also am interested in machine learning techniques, particularly likelihood-free inference methods.
