I am a PhD candidate in Extragalactic Astrophysics at UCL. I am studying the ways in which galaxy evolution is influenced by environmental factors using the SDSS and DESI surveys ðŸ”­. 

I am deriving gas mass estimates from spectroscopy using photoionization modelling and machine learning. Using weak lensing to derive dark matter halo masses.
