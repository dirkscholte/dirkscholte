I am a PhD Researcher in Extragalactic Astrophysics at UCL.  I am studying galaxy evolution through some of the largest optical spectroscopic surveys: SDSS and DESI ðŸ”­. 

I am deriving gas mass estimates from spectroscopy using photoionization modelling and machine learning. Using weak lensing to derive dark matter halo masses.
